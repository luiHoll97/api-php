# Instruct-ERIC php-api Test

This is my first exposure to PHP & Laravel in a small API-based project. Coming from PERN stack with Typescript, there was a lot of trial and error involved, especially with underexpected errors due to occasionally forgetting to add semi colons!

## Task Overview

- [x] Endpoint GET for all services
- [x] Endpoint GET for services filtered by countryCode (not case sensitive)
- [x] Endpoint POST to either update or add a new service, linked to `Ref`
- [ ] Docker Successful Setup
- [x] Cli Commands for all Endpoints
- [ ] Include OpenAISpecification

### Failures

- Docker Successful Setup
- Include OpenAISpecification

  ### Docker

  My Docker set up seemed to have a few problems so I can't say the setup was successful. I referred to the official documentation initially for my virtual desktop (Linux) to download the desktop client but ran into issues in the terminal. I was able to set up containers but not to successfully run my application.

  My next point of call was to pull my project onto my Mac locally and try launching Docker Desktop there (which has an easier download). I thought this would help me visualise my problems. I had no luck so moved on!

  ### OpenAISpecification

  I simply ran out of time with my project and initially had not researched much into this as it wasn't part of minimum functionality. I have no other comment!
