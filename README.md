## Instruct-ERIC php-api Test

This is my first exposure to PHP & Laravel in a small API-based project. Coming from PERN stack with Typescript, there was a lot of trial and error involved, especially with underexpected errors due to occasionally forgetting to add semi colons!

### Task Overview

- [x] Endpoint GET for all services
- [x] Endpoint GET for services filtered by countryCode (not case sensitive)
- [x] Endpoint POST to either update or add a new service, linked to `Ref`
- [ ] Docker Successful Setup
- [x] Cli Commands for all Endpoints
